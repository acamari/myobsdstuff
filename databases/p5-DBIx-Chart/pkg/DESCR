The DBIx::Chart extends SQL syntax to provide directives for
generating chart images. By subclassing DBI, it makes every SQL
capable data source with a DBI driver appear to natively support
charting/graphing.

DBIx::Chart builds on the SQL syntax introduced in DBD::Chart to
render pie charts, bar charts, box&whisker charts (aka boxcharts),
histograms, Gantt charts, and line, point, and area graphs.

For detailed usage information, see the included dbixchart.html
webpage.

See DBI(3) for details on DBI.
