Starman is a PSGI perl web server that has unique features such as:

High Performance
    Uses the fast XS/C HTTP header parser

Preforking
    Spawns workers preforked like most high performance UNIX servers do.
    Starman also reaps dead children and automatically restarts the
    worker pool.

Signals
    Supports HUP for graceful restarts, and TTIN/TTOU to dynamically
    increase or decrease the number of worker processes.

Superdaemon aware
    Supports Server::Starter for hot deploy and graceful restarts.

Multiple interfaces and UNIX Domain Socket support
    Able to listen on multiple intefaces including UNIX sockets.

Small memory footprint
    Preloading the applications with --preload-app command line option
    enables copy-on-write friendly memory management. Also, the minimum
    memory usage Starman requires for the master process is 7MB and
    children (workers) is less than 3.0MB.

PSGI compatible
    Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks

HTTP/1.1 support
    Supports chunked requests and responses, keep-alive and pipeline
    requests.

UNIX only
    This server does not support Win32.
