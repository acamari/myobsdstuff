HTTP::Parser::XS is a fast, primitive HTTP request/response parser.

The request parser can be used either for writing a synchronous HTTP
server or a event-driven server.

The response parser can be used for writing HTTP clients.

Note that even if this distribution name ends ::XS, pure Perl
implementation is supported, so you can use this module on compiler-less
environments.
